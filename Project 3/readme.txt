This is the project space for Project 3 of the FYS-STK4155 course. 

Some thoughts about the project: This was my first encounter with a Convolutional Neural Network. Since I will be using CNN models and explainable AI methods in my master project, I wanted to get some insights of the different parts of the model by visualising them. It was fun and interesting to see how different pattern evolved, but I learned that simple visualisations are not sufficient to make the model interpretable. For that, I hope some of the explainable AI methods that will be covered in the spring course "IN4310 â€“ Deep Learning for Image Analysis" can be more suitable.

The following files are included in this repository:
project_3.pdf: The project report
animations.ipynb: Contains the animations and plots of the various CNN layers
plots.ipynb: Contains all other plots
pytorch_cnn.py: Contains the CNN model and some functions for training and testing the data.
pytorch_ffnn.py: Contains the FFNN model and the grid search for learning rate and regularisation.
pytorch_gridsearch_hyperparam: Contains the gridsearch loops used for the CNN model.
pytorch_gridsearch_arch.py: Contains a search over different kernel sizes, pooling sizes and strides. This search was performed but the results were not included in the report due to time limitations.
