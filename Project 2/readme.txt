A short description of codes used in this project:

- plots_classification.ipynb and plots_regression.ipynb are Jupyter Notebooks that contain plots and extra material for the report
- utils.py contain functions and feed-forward neural network written by me
- ffnn.py contains the feed-forward neural network code by K&R
- functions.py contain the learning schedules by K&R and some additional functions needed to run the scripts written by me
- classification.py contains loop over eta and lambda for all model set-up
- momentum.py contains loop to update momentum for best results from classification
- plots_gd.py and plots_gd.py contain plots comparing gradients descent method with different learning rate, automatic differentiation, regression methods
